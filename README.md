 ## My Poject Name : Technology and Electronics .

# my project involves creating an Technology and Electronics website with several features and functionalities. Here are more then 5 key features and functionalities of your project:

1. ### **Multi-Category Support**: The website supports a single category, "Technology and Electronics," and allows you to list and manage products related to this category.

2. ### **User-Friendly Home Page**: The home page includes a user-friendly interface with a navigation bar, banner, and footer. It displays at least 6 brand names, each with an image and name, to help users navigate the site.

3. ### **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar contains options for Home, Add Product, My Cart, and Login. It provides easy access to essential functions and user account management.

4. ### **Add Product Page**: Users can add products to the website by filling out a form. The form includes fields for Image, Name, Brand Name, Type, Price, Short Description, and Rating.

5.  ### **Product Types**: Products can be categorized based on their type, such as phones, computers, headphones, etc. This categorization helps users find specific products within the Technology and Electronics category.

6. ### **Brand-Based Product Pages**: Clicking on a brand name redirects the user to a dedicated page showcasing products from that brand. Each brand page includes a slider with advertisement images and a list of related products.

7. ### **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, and the website stores the selected items in a database. A success message (toast/alert) informs the user of successful additions to the cart.

8. ### **Product Details Page**: Users can view detailed information about a product by clicking on the "Details" button. This page provides relevant product details, and it includes an "Add to Cart" button.

9. ### **Authentication**: The website implements email and password-based authentication. Users can register or log in, and a protected/private route ensures that only logged-in users can access certain pages, such as the product detail page.

10. ### **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: The website offers a theme toggle feature, allowing users to switch between dark and light themes for the home page. This feature enhances user experience and accessibility.

Optional features:

11. **User Profiles**: Display the user's name and profile picture on the navigation bar after login.

12. **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out of their accounts for security and privacy.

13. ###  **Tablet Responsiveness**: Implement responsive design for tablet devices, in addition to desktop and mobile.

14. ### **Full Website Theme Toggle**: Extend the dark/light theme toggle to cover the entire website for a consistent user experience.

15. ### **404 Page**: Create a custom 404 (not found) page to handle situations where users access non-existent routes or pages, improving the user experience.

These features and functionalities will make my Technology and Electronics website a comprehensive platform for users to browse, shop, and manage products in the Technology and Electronics category while ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
